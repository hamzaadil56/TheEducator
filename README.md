Content for our presentation
Here’s a structure for our presentation, breaking down each stage with suggested slide headings:

### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Slide 1: Title Slide**
     - Title of the project, your team name, hackathon event details.
   
   - **Slide 2: Problem Statement**
     - Challenges in accessing education in remote areas like Uganda due to lack of internet.

### 2. **Solution Overview**
   - **Slide 3: Project Overview**
     - Brief explanation of the mobile and server-based AI application.
   
   - **Slide 4: The Core Technologies**
     - Overview of llama-3.2 LLM models (1B, 3B, 11B, 90B), multi-modal capabilities, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

### 3. **System Architecture**
   - **Slide 5: System Setup**
     - Diagram showing the application on student phones and the server in the school.

   - **Slide 6: Offline Mode Functionality**
     - Description of how students use mobile applications with llama-3.2-1B and 3B models offline.
